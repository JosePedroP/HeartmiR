		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">What is HeartmiR?</h1>
		
		<p>Welcome to <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b>, a webserver that allows for the query of 
		both microRNAs (miR) and mRNAs in order to identify relevant miR-mRNA interactions in the context of late
		heart development in mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>). <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> is based 
		on the integration of a large number of potential miRNA-mRNAs interactions derived from experimental and 
		computational approaches with a unique dataset comprising time-resolved dual expression profiles of microRNAs 
		and mRNAs during murine heart development. More specifically, interactions were retrieved from five 
		different resources and evaluated based on parallel expression profiling of 9211 mRNA and 386 
		microRNAs during the development period (from E10.5 to E19.5) and additionally in adult and old murine 
		heart tissue.</p>
		
		<p><b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> is designed to serve as comprehensive tool for query, 
		visualisation and identification of relevant miR-mRNA interactions for heart development. Its use is 
		intuitive: To proceed with the analysis, the user inputs gene symbols or Entrez Gene IDs (according to 
		NCBI annotation) or microRNA IDs (according to miRBase) of interest and can search for mRNAs targeted 
		by input miRs, miRs targeting input mRNAs or both.</p>
		
		<p>After the search is carried out, <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> presents the 
		results in tables including identified miR-mRNA interactions, their correlation, experimental validation, 
		and relative predictor scores, as well as indications whether target genes have been associated with heart 
		development or transcriptional regulation. This combined information enables the user to assess the 
		relevance of the retrieved interactions. To refine the search, a threshold for absolute Kendall's 
		correlation can be specified (default value is 0.4).</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, expression levels for miR – mRNA pairs can be visualised both as line plots and compact 
		heat maps. Finally, all retrieved interactions can be downloaded for further inspection.</p>
		
		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">What data is included in HeartmiR?</h1>
		
		<p><b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> is based on the integration of a large number of 
		potential miR-mRNA interactions derived from experimental and computational approaches with a unique 
		gene expression data set, which includes parallel system wide measurement of mRNA and miR levels in 
		the murine heart during development.</p>
		
		<h2 style="color: #cc0000;">miRNA-mRNA interactions</h2>
		
		<p>We gathered five different datasets of miR-mRNA interactions that are publically available and based 
		on experiments or computational predictions. Each dataset was individually analysed and filtered according 
		to authors' recommendations in order to obtain interactions of high confidence. The datasets were treated 
		as follows:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h:outputLink value="https://www.microrna.org"><b>microRNA.org</b></h:outputLink>: 
				Two files were obtained from microRNA.org <h:outputLink value="https://www.microrna.org/microrna/getDownloads.do">download page</h:outputLink>.
				These files were labelled in microRNAs.org as ""Good mirSVR score, Conserved miRNA" and the "Good mirSVR score, 
				Non-conserved miRNA". Interactions were subsequently merged into a single list and duplicated interactions were 
				removed. To increase confidence, we removed all interactions that had a mirSVR score higher than -0.1 following 
				the <h:outputLink value="https://www.microrna.org/microrna/getDownloads.do">indications given by creators of 
				microRNAs.org</h:outputLink>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h:outputLink value="https://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/index.html"><b>Pita</b></h:outputLink>: 
				The file for mouse miR targets in mouse was obtained from the 
				<h:outputLink value="https://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/catalogs/PITA_sites_mm9_0_0_ALL.tab.gz">
				Pita Download Predictions Page</h:outputLink>. A minimal score of -10 was set according to the authors' 
				specifications in the <h:outputLink value="https://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/index.html">
				FAQ/Notes page</h:outputLink>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h:outputLink value="http://www.mirdb.org/miRDB/index.html"><b>miRDB</b></h:outputLink>: The  
				<h:outputLink value="http://www.mirdb.org/miRDB/download/miRDB_v5.0_prediction_result.txt.gz">most recent version of 
				miRDB</h:outputLink> was downloaded. According to the authors, stated in the same page, a gene with a score higher 
				that 50 can be considered to be likely a miR target. Therefore, we used only interaction that had a score higher 
				than 50 to be included in <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h:outputLink value="http://www.targetscan.org/mmu_71/"><b>TargetScan</b></h:outputLink>: A
				<h:outputLink value="http://www.targetscan.org/mmu_71/mmu_71_data_download/Summary_Counts.all_predictions.txt.zip">
				summary file</h:outputLink> was retrieved and interactions miRNA-mRNA interactions for Mus musculus were extracted. 
				Finally, only interactions with "Cumulative weighted context++ score" lower than -0.1 were taken to increase 
				prediction confidence as <h:outputLink value="https://elifesciences.org/content/4/e05005">advised by the authors</h:outputLink>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<h:outputLink value="http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/"><b>MirTarBase</b></h:outputLink>: miRNA-mRNA interactions 
				based on experimental data were <h:outputLink value="http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/cache/download/6.1/mmu_MTI.xls">
				downloaded from MirTarBase Version 6.1</h:outputLink>. The full set of interactions was included in 
				<b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>For all datasets, duplicated interactions were removed and miRNA targets were commonly mapped to their gene Symbol and Entrez Gene 
		ID for simpler identification.</p>
		
		<p>Next, we integrated the interactions with our gene expression data for heart development in mouse. We only kept interactions 
		for which the corresponding mRNAs and miRNAs have higher expression than 32 units for at least one time point during the time 
		course experiment (See Sabour &amp; Machado et al., 2016 for more information). To facilitate interpretation, scores were ranked 
		according to their relative value for each of the computationally derived interaction sets. The top 1% interactions are given 
		the rank of 1, the top 1-2% are ranked as 2 and so on.</p>
		
		<p>After filtering, the final numbers of imported interactions from the different resources together with the corresponding 
		publication are following:</p>

		<h2 style="color: #cc0000;">Dual miR and mRNA transcriptome</h2>
		
		<p>The gene expression data set was obtained from Affymetrix Gene Chips measurements (microarray of mRNAs 
		and miRs during the development period (from E10.5 to E19.5) and additionally includes measurements of 
		adult and old murine heart tissue. To reduce noise in the data, only mRNAs and miRs with an absolute value 
		of 32 in at least one time point were considered as being expressed. The miR and mRNA parallel expression 
		profiling combined with the retrieved validated and experimental interaction were used  to assess 9211 mRNAs 
		and 386 miRs surpassing the expression threshold.  Correlation between mRNAs and miRs was calculated using 
		Kendall rank correlation, which provides a more robust measure for similarity of expression profiles compared 
		to standard Pearson correlation. Furthermore, we calculated alternative  Kendall correlation coefficients for 
		developmental time points only ("Kendall Dev") and for the all experiment series ("Kendall")</p>
		
		<p>Additional information was added to the mRNAs to indicate if they participate in processes related to heart 
		development or transcription regulation based on their Gene Ontology annotation.</p>
		
		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">Querying HeartmiR</h1>
		
		<p>For querying, <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> presents two main options: (i) <b>Search Genes/miRs</b> 
		and (ii) <b>Search Interaction</b>.</p>
		
		<p>The <b>search Genes/miRs</b> displays a web page where mRNA or miR identifiers can be used as input. Currently, 
		mRNAs can be searched using Gene Name, Gene Symbol, Entrez Gene ID (according to NCBI annotation) and Affymetrix 
		ID. The miRNAs can be searched using miRBase ID, Affymetrix ID and Transcript ID. Moreover, the user can set a 
		threshold for absolute correlation (“Kendall”), resulting in the exclusion of interactions with lower correlation 
		between miRNA and the corresponding target mRNA. Thus, using for instance, a threshold of 0.4, only miR-mRNA 
		interactions that have a Kendall correlation higher than 0.4 or lower than -0.4 will be shown. By default, this 
		value is set to 0.4.</p> 

		<p>Once the search parameters are set, the user  presses one of the three search buttons accordingly to the input data: 
		(i) <b>Search Genes</b> and (ii) <b>Search microRNAs</b> attempt to match the input identifiers either with genes and 
		miRs in the database respectively; while the (iii) <b>Search Both</b> matches the input both to miRs and mRNA and 
		performs the search. Please note that queries using the <b>Search Both</b> ooption are slower than the other two options, 
		so we recommend only using it if the query includes a combination of gene and microRNA identifiers.</p>
		
		<img src="./images/HeartmiR1_1.png" border="0"/>
		
		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">Interaction profiling</h1>
		
		<p>The query results are displayed in two tabs: <b>Correlation</b> and <b>Expression Heatmaps</b>. In the first, 
		the retrieved interactions for the queried mRNAs and miRs are displayed along the corresponding scores, correlation 
		measures and information in tables. In the example case, two genes (Fam122b and Smoc2) serve as  input. 
		Performing the query leads to the display of miRNAs targeting these genes. In the alternative case that 
		miRNA identifiers are used as input, <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> displays all protein-coding 
		genes targeted by the given miRNAs.</p>

		<p>In the tables, following information can be found:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Kendall</b> and <b>Kendall Dev</b> values, i.e. the Kendall correlation of the miR-mRNA pairs using 
				the full time series (including adult and old heart tissue) or development time points only, respectively. 
				Positive values indicate similarity of expression profiles, while negative values indicate anti-correlation 
				of expression profiles and suggest potential repression of the target mRNA by the miRNA.
			</li>
			<li>
				The columns <b>Support type and PubMed</b> inform us whether the interaction was already experimentally 
				validated, what type of experiment was performed and in which publication the interaction was reported.
			</li>
			<li>
				The mRNA.org, <b>Pita</b>, <b>miRDB</b> and <b>TScan</b> columns display the percentile rank according 
				to the scores obtained in the each predictor tool, as mentioned above.
			</li>
			<li>
				The columns <b>HD</b> (<b>H</b>eart <b>D</b>evelopment) and <b>TF</b> (<b>T</b>ranscription <b>F</b>actors) 
				provide indication whether the miRNAs targets were associated in the relevant processes based on their Gene 
				Ontology Annotation (for the IDs GO:0007507 and GO:0003700, respectively).
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Finally, the user can select for which interactions the temporal expression profiles should be displayed by 
		checking the box at the end of the row.</p>
		
		<img src="./images/HeartmiR2_1.png" border="0"/>
		
		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">Expression Plots</h1>
		
		<p>The user of <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> can plot any number of genes and miRNAs from the 
		displayed interactions. To visualise the expression of a single miRNA-mRNA pair, the user can simply press the 
		<b>plot</b> button of the desired interaction. Alternatively, it is possible to plot the expression of several 
		elements from the table by selecting the desired elements on the "<b>Check for plot</b>" column and then press 
		the <b>Plot Checked</b> button that can be found on the top of the table (See figure above, red arrow). 
		Additionally, the user can pick interactions from the multiple tables and have them displayed by pressing 
		the relevant <b>Plot</b> button (see figure below, red arrow), present at the end of the page.</p>
		
		<img src="./images/HeartmiR3_1.png" border="0"/>
		
		<p>In the plots, expression values for miR and mRNA are displayed in log2 scale. Each plot includes a cut 
		off line of log2 equals 5 and mRNAs or miRs below this value were considered not expressed at the corresponding 
		time point.</p>
		
		<p>Please note that the plots are interactive using the panel above the plots. For instance, one can zoom in 
		or out, or display the expression values at a certain point. It is also possible to deselect or reselect the 
		profiles and the cut-off line by clicking with the mouse on the relevant genes or miRs shown in the legend on 
		the right side as seen in the example below. Plots can be saved as PNG files.</p>
		
		<img src="./images/HeartmiR4_1.png" border="0"/>
		
		<p>At the end of the page the user will find two buttons labelled <b>Filter</b> (see figure above, yellow arrow), 
		which allows to increase the correlation stringency for Kendall or Kendall Dev measures. Please note if you 
		try to lower the stringency by choosing a smaller correlation thresholds, the tables will remain unchanged. 
		Here, you need to perform a new search with the lower threshold. Finally, the user can export the results 
		into a tab delimited table, by pressing the <b>Download tables</b> button (see table figure above, black arrow).</p>
		
		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">Heatmaps</h1>
		
		<p>Besides the expression plots, the user may also create <b>Expression heatmaps</b> provided by the tool using 
		the expression values. This functionality provides an alternative for displaying the expression patterns (see 
		figure below). The user can verify the expression values by hovering the mouse pointer on the heatmaps. 
		Additionally, the user can zoom in and out in specific areas or  rescale back to default. Finally, the user 
		can download the image as a PNG file.</p>
		
		<img src="./images/HeartmiR5.png" border="0"/>
		
		<h1 style="color: #cc0000;">Searching for specific correlations</h1>
		
		<p>Finally, it is also possible to query <b style="color: #cc0000;">Heart</b><b>miR</b> for a specific miR-mRNA 
		validated or predicted interaction. For this, the user simply was to select the <b>Search correlation</b> button 
		in the upper tab and then insert the  miR and mRNA identifiers  to specify  the interaction. If the interaction 
		is found in the database, it will output information about the mRNA and miRNA, their correlation based on the 
		experiment expression values and generates a plot which shows their expression during the experiment.</p>
